Hi, I am Po-Chiang (Bob), Po-Chiang Chao (Bob Chao)

2
00:00:03,14 --> 00:00:11,09
I've participated in the project for about 6-7 years, starting from about 2002.

3
00:00:11,15 --> 00:00:17,17
At first I started off translating technical documents and promoting web standards.

4
00:00:17,17 --> 00:00:21,90
Since I am a web designer myself, I find it troublesome to have many different standards.

5
00:00:21,90 --> 00:00:24,61
That's why I wanted to promote web standards.

6
00:00:24,78 --> 00:00:36,72
The locale owner from two terms before, Lin Hong-De (piaip), invited me to help set up the moztw website, so I helped him.

7
00:00:36,72 --> 00:00:40,91
After he entered the military service, I took over most of the works. Kind of like a lackey.

8
00:00:40,99 --> 00:00:47,64
Up to now, the locale owner keeps changing, but I'm still helping out.

9
00:00:47,71 --> 99:59:59,00
Mainly with marketing and promotion, and mostly to do with coordinating the community.
